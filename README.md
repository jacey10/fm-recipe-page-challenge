## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- I had a better understanding of how to use flexbox to create responsive layouts and where to use it.
- I haven't really worked with lists and tables in a long time. Neither did I have fully understand how to style them. While doing so, I stumbled on some problems like choosing the right border-bottom for the table and styling markers for list. This challenge gave me the opportunity to learn a lot more about how to do all these.
- I had a better understanding of "width:100%" and how elements with this property expands to fill the width of their containers.
- I implemented the mobile first design, before writing media queries for larger screens (i.e. tablets and desktops).
- With the aid of ChatGPT, I learned how to use customers markers instead of default list markers to avoid layout issues.

### Continued development
- I would continue to explore how to create layouts that are responsive across many screens and devices.
- I would learn more about styling lists and tables.
- I would also learn more about using Absolute positioning.
